# Cpp-_Final Project
This program will modify the progrom of C-_SalaryReport_Employees repository to:
1. Store the data in Bianry file and access it in Random Access mode.
2. Replace Class with Structure for Employee and Department.
3. Inside each structure, replace all string variables with array of characters. 
4. Make Employee and Department editable. That menas, the user should be able to edit a given Employee and Department.
   You can allow the user to edit Employee name, age, etc. and assign him/her to different departments. Similarly department
   name and department head can be changed. However, do not allow the user to Employee ID in the Employee file and Department ID
   in the department file.
5. Please note that the data will no longer be stored in the array. Instead, it should be written to the file as soon as you
   collect the data from the user. If you are editing a record, read it from the file, collect new data from the user,
   store the record back to the file in the same place, it was found inside the file. That means, the menu will not have
   options to save data to file or read data from file. Also this should provide the ability for user to create unlimited 
   number of employees and dpeartments.
